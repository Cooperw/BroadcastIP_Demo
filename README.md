# BroadcastIP_Demo
Demo of my broadcastIP script that I use for Raspberry Pis.

This script is run a service on boot and connects to an IRC channel hosted by foonetic.net to publish the hostname and local IP so that you can locate the pi on your network.

Feel free to use this script but you may need to modify it if you wish to use different IRC servers and channels.
**I cannot guarentee the safety of this script, use at your own risk.**

Run

```sudo ./install```

to setup the service and move files around.
